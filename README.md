Javascript was used to interact with a card deck API in order to build the game of War. A scoreboard was made by using Javascript to manipulate local storage in the browser.

## Optimizations

Some ways I could improve this project is by adding transitions/animations when the cards are dealt to both players. I think the use of transitions/animations would provide a better user experience.

## Lessons Learned

The biggest lesson I have learned is that there is always room for improvement to make a project better.
